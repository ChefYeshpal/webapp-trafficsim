# webapp-trafficsim
A traffic light manager simulator

This project is for week 6 of [siege](https://siege.hackclub.com), with the theme being "Signal". The initial idea is to make something akin to ["intersection controller"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.shadowtree.software.trafficbuilder&hl=en_GB&pli=1).
Although, it will probably be much much simpler, with less logic involved as I currently dont have much knowledge in how to add driving logic to something that's on web. The reason why I prefer making things that can be displayed on web is, because it is much much simpler to test and deploy it in such a way that other's can test it as welll (looking at you stonemasons ;D)

## Things to do

- Add roads
- Add cars
    - Maybe make a template or something, so that the computer itself can randomly select a colour for the cars. Otherwise it would just look like ants...
- A traffic signal thing
    - Red and green will be there, the user will control the red and green lights
    - If the user makes a lane wait too long, then the drivers may crash into one another in an act of road rage
    - Also, will need to add a system so that the crashed cars automatically get removed after some time (5secs)

## Devlog

- Created repository and coned
- Updated README
- Made the basic files (html, css, and js)
